Problem Statement: 
Write a paragraph explaining the motivation behind choosing the project

> We have chosen to build a Cash Register webpage for this project. We all have worked in retail before, so we have seen how the point of sale really works and the system really fascinates us. This type of register can be used in any kind of retail for any kind of business. So, we came up with the idea of creating one on our own. We had some other ideas for the project like currency exchange webpage and bus tracking webpage, but the cash register webpage was the one which was most relatable. Thus, we were highly motivated to choose cash register webpage for this project.

List of users: Who will be using your system
In the broad context, the users of the system are going to be store owners and small business owners. This webpage will be easy to access and do the required functionalities like adding inventories, taking payments etc. This webpage will make the day to day transactions of the business easier and simpler. 
Besides that, under our system the users are going to be administrators, cashiers and managers for their specific functions like work hour shift record and sales report management. The users will have the control on the system of the basis of their rank. Like the administrator will have the authority for almost everything within the system like adding and deleting the existing employees, adjusting the shifts for employees etc.
