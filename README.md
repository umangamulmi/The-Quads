Problem Statement: 
Write a paragraph explaining the motivation behind choosing the project

> We have chosen to build a Cash Register webpage for this project. We all have worked in retail before, so we have seen how the point of sale really works and the system really fascinates us. This type of register can be used in any kind of retail for any kind of business. So, we came up with the idea of creating one on our own. We had some other ideas for the project like currency exchange webpage and bus tracking webpage, but the cash register webpage was the one which was most relatable. Thus, we were highly motivated to choose cash register webpage for this project.
